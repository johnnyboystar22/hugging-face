# TorchAO

[TorchAO](https://github.com/pytorch/ao) is an architecture optimization library for PyTorch, it provides high performance dtypes, optimization techniques and kernels for inference and training.

Before you begin, make sure the following libraries are installed with their latest version:

```bash
pip install --upgrade torch torchao
```


```py
from transformers import TorchAoConfig, AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B"
# We support int4_weight_only, int8_weight_only and int8_dynamic_activation_int8_weight
# More examples and documentations for arguments can be found in https://github.com/pytorch/ao/tree/main/torchao/quantization#other-available-quantization-techniques
quantization_config = TorchAoConfig("int4_weight_only", group_size=128)
quantized_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name, device_map="auto", quantization_config=quantization_config)

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
input_text = "What are we having for dinner?"
input_ids = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

output = quantized_model.generate(**input_ids, max_new_tokens=10)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

torchao quantization is implemented with tensor subclasses, currently it does not work with huggingface serialization, both the safetensor option and [non-safetensor option](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/32364), we'll update here with instructions when it's working.
