# DAB-DETR

## Overview

The DAB-DETR model was proposed in [DAB-DETR: Dynamic Anchor Boxes are Better Queries for DETR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12329) by Shilong Liu, Feng Li, Hao Zhang, Xiao Yang, Xianbiao Qi, Hang Su, Jun Zhu, Lei Zhang.
DAB-DETR is an enhanced variant of Conditional DETR. It utilizes dynamically updated anchor boxes to provide both a reference query point (x, y) and a reference anchor size (w, h), improving cross-attention computation. This new approach achieves 45.7% AP when trained for 50 epochs with a single ResNet-50 model as the backbone.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We present in this paper a novel query formulation using dynamic anchor boxes
for DETR (DEtection TRansformer) and offer a deeper understanding of the role
of queries in DETR. This new formulation directly uses box coordinates as queries
in Transformer decoders and dynamically updates them layer-by-layer. Using box
coordinates not only helps using explicit positional priors to improve the query-to-feature similarity and eliminate the slow training convergence issue in DETR,
but also allows us to modulate the positional attention map using the box width
and height information. Such a design makes it clear that queries in DETR can be
implemented as performing soft ROI pooling layer-by-layer in a cascade manner.
As a result, it leads to the best performance on MS-COCO benchmark among
the DETR-like detection models under the same setting, e.g., AP 45.7% using
ResNet50-DC5 as backbone trained in 50 epochs. We also conducted extensive
experiments to confirm our analysis and verify the effectiveness of our methods.*

There are three ways to instantiate a DAB-DETR model (depending on what you prefer):

Option 1: Instantiate DAB-DETR with pre-trained weights for entire model
```py
>>> from transformers import DABDETRForObjectDetection

>>> model = DABDETRForObjectDetection.from_pretrained("IDEA-Research/dab_detr_resnet50")
```

Option 2: Instantiate DAB-DETR with randomly initialized weights for Transformer, but pre-trained weights for backbone
```py
>>> from transformers import DABDETRConfig, DABDETRForObjectDetection

>>> config = DABDETRConfig()
>>> model = DABDETRForObjectDetection(config)
```
Option 3: Instantiate DAB-DETR with randomly initialized weights for backbone + Transformer
```py
>>> config = DABDETRConfig(use_pretrained_backbone=False)
>>> model = DABDETRForObjectDetection(config)
```
